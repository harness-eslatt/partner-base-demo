2024-11-07 mystery - and I think this will be a fun one
the CI based build script creates two files: 
  ./src/environments/environment.prod.ts and
  ./src/environments/environment.ts

it seems to have a defaultApiUrl attribute hardwired to instruqt.io
the following two changes stopped me from being able to browse the landing page
  changing this att to empty string (at least I tried)
  changing this att to http://10.106.73.151:8080

I'm trying to change it because its being used for the ajax calls back to the server

TODO
- where does 'API URL in API Service' output come from?
  

questions
- which of the two files is being used?
- can I change it at all?

works - environment.ts
 - https://backend.sandbox.<+variable.sandbox_id>.instruqt.io
 - 0801 https://backend.sandbox.ed.instruqt.io
 - 0843 https://backend.sandbox.ed.instruqt.io puting environment.ts first
 - 0850 https://backend.slatt.ed.instruqt.io
fails - empty string
- 0831 https://a.b.c.instruqt.io - failed to get to steady state?  new error

works - config.services.ts
 - 0921 https://backend.slatt.ed.instruqt.io
fails
 - 0937 empty string


experiments
- add a flush to investigate mystery

findings
- 0738 empty string in environment.prod.ts is fine
- 0800 empty string in environment.ts fails as expected
- 0919 I can hardwire the value right in config.services.ts
- 0921 I can dump the variable from environment.ts?

SOLVED mysteries
- why does the template compile work but the native does not?
  - WIP had to use a specific docker image

done
- move the build from the template to hardwired in the step for debugging
- 0908 see that I can break src/app/_services/config.service.ts 


src/environments/environment.ts
- the app is very sensitive to defaultApiUrl in this file
- src/app/_services/config.service.ts imports this file

src/app/_services/apiservice.service.ts
- this guy write the url to stdout
- and this guy doesn't come up when the thing fails

pod log when it doesn't work
  Node Express server listening on http://localhost:4000
  nothing

pod log when it works
  Node Express server listening on http://localhost:4000
  API URL in API Service: https://backend.slatt.ed.instruqt.io
  API URL in AppComponent: https://backend.slatt.ed.instruqt.io
  false
  .
  .
  bunch of stuff
  .

problem
  apiservice.service.ts is trying to apply services offered from the backend
  its used from the browser and from serverside client code
  so relative url doesn't help the frontend pod get to the backend pod for stuff

solution
  setup a proxy on the front end that sends anything wanting to get to the backend to the backend
  steps
    put the url back to what was working and see that I can browse the front end again
    add the RUN apk add gettext &&  npm install http-proxy-middleware and see that I can still browse the front end
    add the server.ts proxy piece and see still browse the front end
    change the url prefix and see the the app starts being able to use the backend services
  done
