  how to tune all the yaml in this repo for the user specific
    like container name or whatever
    probably have to move to JEXL and register project variables
    get it to go with hardwired values first

compute - video uses mbp m1
  git

  TODO edslatt/harness-demo
  TODO might need backend container in github.. to get the architecture right
harness account - video uses fresh harness account against a fresh gmail to ensure representative experience
  TODO - might do it all ui yaml for simplicity?
  log into cli
  repo (ui)
    create repo, get clone pat, git commands below to push this repo to new repo in new harness account
    TODO git commands as per above (in rtf)
  templates (ui)
    TODO
      how to do this
      templates aren't supported in cli
      use JEXL for the account stuff to make the yml constant
